# Calculator
Just a simple calculator
If you want you can just download a Calculator.exe in /bin/release :)
But keep in mind that it has less functionality than the Windows calculator or any other, but it can:
- Calculate positive, negative, fractional numbers;
- Calculate roots and cube roots;
- Calculate inverse numbers (1/x) and factorials;
- Raise to a power.
